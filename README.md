## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Runs the app in the development mode.\
### `npm start`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm test`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

### `npm run build`


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
